## eGraph student

In this repository, you will find a project about graph theory that I wanted to create for some reasons, including :
    - I wanted to prepare myself for an internship (where I will work on the k-center problem with capacity problems)
    - I'm very interested in graph theory (I would like to deepen my knowledge in this subject)
    - I would like to build a real app for academic purposes

Project made by @d2dragono and me.


## The goal

There are many objectives in this project, on this app we will be able to :
- Create a graph (directed graph or not, weighted graph or not,...)
- Create a graph thanks to a matrix
- Custom and modify the graph (orientation, color, name, ...)
- Apply differents algorithms as :
    - Graph traversal (Depth-first search, breadth-first search)
    - Shortest path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford-Moore, Floyd-Warshall)
    - Minimum spanning tree (Kruskal, Prim)
    - Flow (minimum/maximum)
    - K-nearest-neighbors
    - Connectivity and research of (strongly) connected components
    - Graph coloring
    - Vehicle routing problem (VRP)
    - ...
- Algorithms' animation step by step
- Informations' window which contained pseudo-code, complexity, principles, ...
- Import/Export a save
- Window of general informations (number of vertices and edges and their position, ...)
- ...

Moreover, I would like to make it in C++, with the aim of learning a new language close to C, and improve my level in object-oriented programming. This one will be useful to me in the future in particular for (simulation) projects.

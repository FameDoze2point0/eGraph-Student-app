# eGraph student

In this repository, you will find a project about graph theory that I wanted to create for some reasons, including :
  - I wanted to prepare myself for an internship (where I will work on k-center problem with capacity problems)
  - I'm very interested in graph theory (I would like to deepen my knowledge in this subject) 
  - I would like to build a real app for academic purposes
  
Project made by @d2dragono and me.


## The goal

There are many objectives in this project, on this app we will be able to :
  - Create graph (directed graph or not, weighted graph or not,...)
  - Create graph thanks to matrix
